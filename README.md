# Take Home Test Section-2

This is my solution to problem 2 in section 2. This uses Flask and Python to create the website itself. 
Also, it uses the Google Sheets API in Python to make changes and get information from a Google Sheet. 
To make this work on your computer you need a credentials .json file with your API info. 
I did not add this as that is user-sensitive info and you have to make it on your own to make it work. 
Once you download the .json file rename it to creds.json and put it in the same directory as the app.py file and everything should work.
